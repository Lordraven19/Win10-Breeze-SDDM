[General]

# INTRODUCTORY WARNING! Don't set silly values. Fire up the terminal and type in "sddm-greeter --test-mode --theme /usr/share/sddm/themes/breeze-514" first to see what you've done by changing this file.

# (KDE option) WALLPAPER FADER VISIBLE. I don't really understand this option, look further down if you want to turn off the wallpaper fader | Default=image
type=image

# (KDE option) SET BACKGROUND COLOR. This is only relevant if you don't have a wallpaper | Default=#1d99f3
color=#1d99f3

# (KDE option) SET WALLPAPER. | Default=/usr/share/wallpapers/Next/contents/images/3200x2000.png
background=/usr/share/wallpapers/Next/contents/images/3200x2000.png

# SET SCREEN DIMENSIONS. E.g. 1920 and 1080. | Defaults=1600 and 900
ScreenWidth=
ScreenHeight=

### [Blur & fader] -------------------------------------

# SET BLUR STRENGTH. You're adjusting FastBlur's radius here. If you set the value to 0 you will turn off the blur entirely | Default=100
BlurRadius=

# SET WALLPAPER FADER STRENGTH. This is the bit of code that darkens your wallpaper. To turn it off set the value to 0; to have it fully operational set it to 1. Use decimal values between those two for adjustments | Default=1
WallpaperFaderStrength=

# TURN ON TEXT SHADOWS. If you've turned off both the blur and the fader, text will not be legible. Turn on text shadows by setting the following value to "true". | Default=false
TextShadowsVisible=

# DRAW A SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT PANEL AT THE BOTTOM. This is another fix if you've turned off the blur and fader; set to "true" if you need it | Default=false
PanelVisible=

# DRAW A SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT CIRCLE BEHIND AVATAR. Another fix for non-blurred and non-shaded themes; set to "true" if you need it | Default=false
DrawCircleBehindAvatar=

# DRAW A SLIGHTLY TRANSPARENT CIRCLE BEHIND ACTION ICONS. Another fix for non-blurred and non-shaded themes; set to "true" if you need it | Default=false
DrawCircleBehindActionIcons=

### [Fonts] -------------------------------------

# SET FONT NAME. E.g. Lato | Default=Noto Sans
Font=

# SET FONT HINTING STYLE. Values are: PreferDefaultHinting, PreferNoHinting, PreferVerticalHinting, PreferFullHinting | Default=PreferDefaultHinting
FontHinting=

# SET FONT POINT SIZE. E.g. 11 | Default=10
FontSize=

# SET CLOCK FONT SIZE. E.g. 40 | Default=48
ClockSize=

# SET DATE FONT SIZE. E.g. 20 | Default=24
DateSize=

### [Icons] -------------------------------------

# SET AVATAR SIZE. This option is currently broken, see bug report on GitHub.
# AvatarPixelSize=

# CHANGE AVATAR OUTLINE COLOR. I've mainly added this option so you can use it as a hack to turn off the avatar outline. Just type in "transparent" below and you're good to go. | Default=PlasmaCore.ColorScope.textColor
AvatarOutlineColor=

# SET ACTION ICONS' SIZE. e.g. 64 | Default=iconSize (note: this is probably 48 in pixels so take that as a guideline)
ActionIconSize=

# CHANGE THE ICON THEME. We can't change the icon theme from here. You need to copy your plasmarc file from .config to /var/lib/sddm/.config and then change the ownernship of the file to the user called sddm. Note that the icons are picked up from the Plasma(desktop) theme so that's why you're copying plasmarc. It would also probably be good to remove sddm's cache (/var/lib/sddm/.cache)
